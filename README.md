# SchnorrZKP-Python

A Python demonstration of the Schnorr Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, showcasing the key generation, commitment, challenge, response, and verification phases.

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that implements the Schnorr Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol. It demonstrates the mathematical and cryptographic principles underlying the protocol, including prime generation, the creation of a generator for the subgroup, and the Schnorr ZKP steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Sympy (for prime generation and validation)

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arkay92/SchnorrZKP-Python.git
cd SchnorrZKP-Python
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to see a demonstration of the Schnorr ZKP protocol:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the demonstration, improve efficiency, or extend functionality are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-pull request workflow.
